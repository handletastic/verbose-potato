#Notes on all the files
##This file
In this file notes are added as the project progresses to illustrate the development process and to act like footnotes for each script. The notes are organised according to directories
##directory: top level
This is the main directory of the website
###index.php
This is the main index file of the website
###mail.php
###notes.md
###register.php
###search_result.php
###store.php

##directory: ajax
PHP files in this directory handles ajax requests from the client side, done via jquery (see scripts.js in the "js" directory). It is good practice to put all the ajax request handlers in the same directory to be able to easily manage them and secure them should it be required.
